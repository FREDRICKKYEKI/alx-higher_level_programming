Module that contains the find_peak function
"""
# Technical interview preparation:
# Write a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.
# Prototype: def find_peak(list_of_integers):
#   - You are not allowed to import any module
#   - Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you donâ€™t need
#   - to go through all numbers to find a peak)
#   - 6-peak.py must contain the function
#   - 6-peak.txt must contain the complexity of your algorithm:
#       - O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)
# Note: there may be more than one peak in the list
